      <h3 id="using-lightning-wallet"><a href="#using-lightning-wallet"></a>Using Lightning wallet</h3>

<p>Once Bitcoin wallet is created you can also start using a Lightning wallet which means opening a payment channel with a peer of your choice and using it to send payments across a Lightning network.</p>

<h3 id="payment-channel"><a href="#payment-channel"></a>Payment channel</h3>

<p>Technically speaking it is a multisig lockbox on a Bitcoin blockchain which is mutually controlled by you and a peer of your choice. It is designed in such a way that once a certain amount of coins is locked in there you can use those coins to send and receive Lightning payments.</p>

<p>You can close a payment channel and get the rest of your locked coins back to your Bitcoin wallet at any time, either by agreeing with a peer on a mutual closing transaction or via forced channel closing if your peer becomes uncooperative.</p>

<h3 id="forced-channel-closing"><a href="#forced-channel-closing"></a>Forced channel closing</h3>

<p>This is an option which is always available to both you and your peer once a new payment channel is open. No matter what happens a channel can always be closed without peer’s permission with the rest of channel balance refunded back to your Bitcoin wallet.</p>

<p>That said, a refunding Bitcoin transaction created by forced channel closing is encumbered in a time lock of 144 Bitcoin blocks so closing a channel uncooperatively will take about one day of waiting before your channel coins are sent back to your Bitcoin wallet.</p>

<p>You may also want to watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-WJPjAp5u8">this video</a> which covers all the ways a payment channel could be closed in a great detail.</p>

<h3 id="commit-transaction-fee"><a href="#commit-transaction-fee"></a>Commit transaction fee</h3>

<p>You may encounter a message which says that your Lightning payment sum exceeds a Bitcoin commit transaction fee when you try to send a payment while your channel balance is low.</p>

<p>This may sound strange since Lightning payment is an off-chan value transfer so what does an on-chain Bitcoin commit transaction have to do with it?</p>

<p>The answer is although sending each Lightning payment indeed does not involve broadcasting a Bitcoin transaction, such a transaction has to be created nevertheless and it must have an appropriate fee for Bitcoin network to accept it in a timely manner.</p>

<p>So an actual amount available for spending in a payment channel will always be slightly less than a nominal amount because it always needs to contain enough funds for Bitcoin commit transaction fee should it ever be broadcasted.</p>
